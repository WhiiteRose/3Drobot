# 🤖 3Drobot

**3Drobot** is a simple front-end project that demonstrates how to integrate interactive 3D objects into a React application using [Spline](https://spline.design/).  
The project also makes use of **TailwindCSS** for styling, **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for smooth animations, and **Vite** as the build tool and development server.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** – JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
- **Spline** – Tool to create and embed 3D objects/animations directly in the browser.
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive design.
- **AOS** – Library for scroll-triggered animations.
- **Vite** – Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and hot reload.

## 🎨 Features

- Integration of an **interactive 3D model** (via Spline).
- Responsive layout with **Tailwind**.
- **Smooth animations** on scroll with AOS.
- **Single Page Project** (front-end only).
- Fast dev server & optimized builds with **Vite**.
